"""This module implements the methods that are attached to the Doc object
produce by the meddocan_pipeline.
By assigning a function that becomes accessible as its own method of a Doc
object, we have more reliable information about the type that can be passed as
a parameter to the function.
Indeed, if the method only accepts Docs produced by the meddocan_pipeline, this
can only be made mandatory by attaching an extension of type ``_.meddocan_doc``
to the document.

The information needed to understand the adjunction of methods to the
`spacy.tokens.Doc` object that are accessed through the personalize attribute
can be found in the `spaCy`_ documentation.

The information needed to understand how to create custom components can be
found in the spaCy documentation `Creating custom pipeline components`_.
